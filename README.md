Car Shopping
============

Some scripts I wrote while doing car purchase research.

I use `car_csv.rb` to collect year, price & mileage from
the search results on Cars.com.

* edit `car_csv.rb` and put in a cars.com search page URL
* `[sudo] gem install mechanize`
* `ruby car_csv.rb > honda_accord.csv
* open the CSV in Excel and make some scatter plots
